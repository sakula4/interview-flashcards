The key to understanding why you should commit that file is found in the following section on Dependency Installation Behavior:

    When terraform init is working on installing all of the providers needed for a configuration, Terraform considers both the version constraints in the configuration and the version selections recorded in the lock file.

    If a particular provider has no existing recorded selection, Terraform will select the newest available version that matches the given version constraint, and then update the lock file to include that selection.

    If a particular provider already has a selection recorded in the lock file, Terraform will always re-select that version for installation, even if a newer version has become available. You can override that behavior by adding the -upgrade option when you run terraform init, in which case Terraform will disregard the existing selections and once again select the newest available version matching the version constraint.
